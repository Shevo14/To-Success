# Teacher Assistant App (Flutter + Firebase)

Cross-platform mobile app helping teachers manage classes, attendance, quizzes, grades, and content. Built with Flutter, Firebase, and Riverpod.

## Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed
- Firebase project created
- FlutterFire CLI installed: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`

## Setup Steps
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
2. Initialize Firebase (creates `lib/firebase_options.dart`):
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   - Select your Firebase project
   - Enable platforms you target (Android, iOS, Web, macOS)
3. Ensure these Firebase products are enabled in console:
   - Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Firestore
   - Storage
   - Cloud Messaging (for push notifications)
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
